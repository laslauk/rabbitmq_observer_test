The system will wait for some time before sending, had some trouble with syncing up. THats why i tried to use the wait-for-it.sh utility but im not sure if it works correctly.


With message broker, its relatively easy to send messages and rely on the asynchronosity handled by the message broker. Its also relatively easy to
use the subscriber / observer model to listen the bus for messages, with HTTP, it would be a messy to start sending messages to different addresses and handling 
the responses. Its easier to handle internal communication with message broker between multiple applications for in example this docker environment, it would've been quite a
messy commuincation with having to responding and waiting and so on if not for subscribe/observer model to the message bus.

My main learnings:
I learned the basics of the message broker rabbit mq with topics.
I had a lot of trouble with the volume and paths but I eventually learned how to use them (hopefully). Since I used the volume path
for installing node packages without knowing that it overrode the other containers data. Im still having some trouble how addresses and paths should be set up
in docker environment, for example I spent some time to figure out that the addresses sometimes should be the name of the docker container.
